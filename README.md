# iOS_Calculator

A simple calculator for iOS.

A calculator made with Swift 2.0 in Xcode for iOS. Done as a project to explore mobile application development. Calculator works with multiple numbers and operations, decimal numbers, and squares. The functionality of the calculator was inspired by my current Casio fx calculator. Another motivation for creating this is that I did not enjoy the default calculator provided on iOS. Calculator design was done in Sketch as well as in StoryBoard. The design of the calculator was mostly for iPhone 6 but works on other iPhones as well.

**Features:**
 An ANS key was added to recall the last answer. Order of precidence has been implimented. The calculator features a screen that displays what your calculating as you punch in the inputs and operations. You can also swipe up and down to change the colours of the operation buttons.

Operations with large number now work smoothly. Labels that display numbers now scale a bit if extra space is needed.

(Updated Jan 4, 2016)
When pressing an operator button after previous operations have been evaluated, it continues by replacing the previous operations with an ANS key. Fixed cases with large numbers that could possibly break the build. Changed squared button into an expont button.
